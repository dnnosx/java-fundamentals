2) Once complete, practice the following on your own machine and paste the commands you run for each step below.

Initializing git folder
    1. In CodingNomads folder, create new folder git_practice
    2. Inside git_practice:
        a. Initialize folder as a git folder (make sure you are in the correct folder when initializing) by running
            the "git init" command within the git_practice folder.
        b. Make new file
        c. Add file
        d. Commit file
        c. On Github, create new git_practice repository
        d. Add this new GitHub repository as a new "remote" to your local Git repo. You can do this by using the command
            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>
        d. Push commit file to Github
        e. Practice the following git flow until you feel comfortable:

            ii.  Add file(s)
            iii. Commit file(s)
            iv.  Push file(s) to Github repository

Adding a remote
    1. Create new personal repository on Github named "git_practice_2".

        (directions are provided on Github with new repo is created)
    3. Push local git repository to your Github using the new remote.

Cloning repository from Github
    1. Find a repository on Github
    2. Clone repository to local machine
